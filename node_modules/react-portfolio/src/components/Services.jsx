                <p>
                    As a student in AI Software Engineering Technology with a strong interest in accessibility and human-centered design, I offer a range of technical and creative services. Whether you’re looking to collaborate on a project or need help with specific tasks, here’s how I can contribute:
                </p>
                <br />

                <h2>AI-Powered Application Development</h2>
                <p>
                I design and develop intelligent applications that leverage machine learning and natural language processing to solve real-world problems. My focus is on building tools that enhance productivity, accessibility, and communication.
                </p>
                <br />

                <h2>Assistive Technology Prototyping</h2>
                <p>
                With a deep commitment to inclusivity, I prototype and test assistive tech solutions—such as wearable devices and task assistants—that improve quality of life for individuals with disabilities or neurodivergence.
                </p>
                <br />

                <h2>Database Design & Development</h2>
                <p>
                    I create efficient and scalable relational databases tailored to service-based platforms and custom use cases. My work includes entity-relationship modeling, normalization, and backend logic integration.
                </p>
                <br />

                <h2>Computer-Aided Design (CAD)</h2>
                <p>
                    I use CAD tools to design functional hardware components for assistive devices and wearables. These designs are grounded in both usability and practical engineering, with an emphasis on real-world implementation.
                </p>
                <br />

                <h2>Collaborative Problem Solving</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm always open to teaming up with others to solve challenging problems—especially in the areas of accessibility, human-computer interaction, and social good through technology.
