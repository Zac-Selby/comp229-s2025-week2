                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Zac Selby, a student in the Artificial Intelligence Software Engineering Technology program at Centennial College. My journey into tech is driven by a strong desire to make a difference—specifically, by building AI-powered tools that support and empower individuals with disabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about accessibility, inclusive design, and the human impact of emerging technologies. My academic work and personal projects are centred around using AI not just as a technical tool, but as a way to create meaningful, real-world change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am not coding or experimenting with new AI models, I enjoy learning about user-centred design, exploring innovative assistive tech, and collaborating on solutions that can make everyday life easier for others.
                </p>
                <p>
